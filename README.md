# [Discuss how you managed the state in your assignment project].

In the reactJs "State" is more important part. If i want to store changable and re-useable data in reactJS "State" is unbetenable way. Its simplest and efficent way to use for store any type data. It can be STRING, NUMBER, ARRAY, OBJECT type data.

# How i managed State ?

const [data, setData] = useState()
Its a simple ReactJs State Declaretion. Its a JavaScript destructing technology. Here "Data" is a dectructing variable and setData is function. Which is set data in the useState hook.
In the time of declare state must declare this state is store what type of data.

If i have data for iterable or addable . Simple i declare a state. Using setData Function i set data in this state.

"setDate" is use for store new data in this state.
"data" is use for use data in another place i need this stored data.
